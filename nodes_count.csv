"eight sprite contains no script why the change? - the sprites added are objects used to hold different functionalities (i.e. scripts) and attributes (variables) in the program - sprite1,2,3 - when i receive <node_value> is utilized for control flow structure to take an action or call a script - when flag clicked is mostly utilized to start up the program by showing the sprite - when this sprite clicked node is an event listener for the sprite click - the show and hide node utilized in script1 and script3 of the first sprite controls the appearance and disappearance of the sprite. - broadcast <node_value> is utilized for sending out information to other functions or scripts similar to a publish subscribe pattern where the broadcast <node_value> handles publishing and when i receive <node_value> handles subscribing - if <condition> node are utilized for decision making as it’s used with the not <node_value> to check if a condition is met before hiding a sprite - set <node_variable> to <value> are utilized for assigning values to variables - - sprite4 - custom blocks are created to handle specific task and can only be used within a script - wait <value> seconds is utilized to introduce delay to the program - wait <node_varible> seconds does same as above but with a variable - if <condition> then block block is utilized as a decision block that takes specific action in the case of the second script, sets a value of true to a variable and assigns a different value to the variable if the condition fails - <node_value> = <node_value> is utilized to compare two values similar to conditional statements in textual program - <node_variable> = <node_value> does same as above only this time with a variable - set size to <node_value> % is utilized as styling node for increasing the size of the sprite to the node_value - go to <node_value> layer is also a ui improvement process similar to z-index in web development - go to x <node_value> y <node_value> is utilized to control the movement of the sprite in the canvas - delete this clone is utilized to remove an entity - for each <node_variable> in <node_value> is utilized to iterate through the list - switch costume is used to change the appearance of the sprite - create clone of myself is used to create another copy of the object similar to object cloning or forking a project repository - change y by <node_value> is utilized for changing the position of the sprite similar to manipulating coordinates - join <node_value> <node_value> is utilized for concatenating two node values - letter <node_value> of <node_value> is used to index a portion of a string from another - length of <nodes_value> is utilized to get the size of string value - change x by <node_value> is similar to change y by <node_value> used for coordinate manipulation on the y-axis - <node_value> * <value> is used multiply two numerical values for multiplication operations - <node_value> + <node_value> is utilized as an addition operator - item <value> of <node_list> is utilized to access a value from a list - sprite5 - custom blocks are utilized for modularization and code reuse - change <node_value> by <value> is utilized to alter the values of a node either decrement or increment - custom block calls are ways the custom blocks are used by calling them in a script - add <node_value> to <node_list> is utilized for adding values to a list - replace <node_value> of <node_list> with <node_value> is used to replace a value at a specific position in a list similar to update a list - sprite6 - delete all of <node_list> is utilized to clear all the values in a node list - <node_value> and <node_value> is used in an if <condition> then block as a conditional and operator to check for two conditions - <node_value> of <node_value> is utilized to access an object property such accessing the x and y position of a sprite - - sprite7 - set <node_value> to <empty_node> is utilized to reset a node value - set volume to <value> % is utilized to control the audio - set <node_value> effect to <node_value> is utilized to control the sound pitch - <node_value> - <node_value> is subtraction operator - reset timer is utilized to start the time at a 00:00:00 time - <node_value> > <value> is utilized for comparing two node values - pick random <node_value> to <node_value> is utilized for random number generation - <node_value> contains <node_value> is utilized to check if a node value is part of a different node value - play sound <node_value> until done just like the name plays a specific sound based on the chosen node value - sprite8 what do they mean? - users add sprites to introduce objects in scratch programs - users utilize nodes such as broadcast <node_value> and when i receive <node_value> to introduce program control flow and could be likened to a publish/subscribe messaging pattern - users utilize event nodes such as when flag clicked to start a scratch program - users utilize nodes such as when this sprite is clicked as an event listener similar to textual codes - users utilizes show and hide node to control the appearance and disappearance of sprites - users utilize the if <condition> then node along side with the not <node_value> conditional operator to introduce conditional statements and for decision in scratch programs - users add nodes such as the set <node_value> to <value> when the intent is to assign values to variables - users create custom blocks in their program to handle specific functionality, introduce modularity and enable code reuse. - users introduce delays in program execution in visual codes by adding the wait <value> seconds node - users utilize the if <condition> then else block as a decision block that executes a program when a condition is met and a different program when it’s not met as well. - users compare two values in scratch using the <node_values> = <node_values> operator mostly used as a conditional node of the if <conditional_node> then block - users utilize nodes such as set size to <node_value> % and go to <node_value> layer for styling and ui improvement - users control movement of sprite and change the coordinates of the sprites utilizing nodes such as go to x <node_value> y<node_value>, change y by <value> and change x by <node_value>. - users utilize nodes such as delete this clone to trash an object - users utilize for each <node_value> in <node_value> to iterate through a list - users change appearance of a sprite or introduce different flavors of a sprite using the switch costume to <node_value> - users implement object cloning or repository forking using the create clone node - users concatenate strings or other node values using the join <node_value> <node_value> - users introduce slicing operation in string or string indexing by add the letter <node_value> of <node_value> - users obtain the length of a variable by adding the length <node_value> - users add nodes such as <node_value> * <node_value>, <node_value> + <node_value>, <node_value> - <node_value> and <node_value> / <node_value> to perform arithmetic operations - users access values in a list by adding the item <value> of <node_list> node - users utilize the change <node_value> by <value> to increment the property of a node - users add items to a list when they add nodes such as ; add <node_value> to <node_list> - users change elements of a node list by adding the replace <node_value> of <node_list> with <node_value> - users delete all elements of a node list by introducing the delete all of <node_list> - users utilize the <node_value> and <node_value> as a condition node inside control nodes such if then <condition_node> block and not <conditon_node> to check for two conditions before executing a program - users access object properties of a sprite such as ascertaining its x and y position of a sprite by introducing the <node_value> of <node_value> - users reset the property of a node value to empty utilizing the set <node_value> to <empty string> - users introduce sound and sound controls with nodes such as play sound <node_value> until done, set volume to <value> % and set <node_value> effect to <node_value> screenshots version 2( https://github.com/nullified33/stuff/ blob/33b28e21f27b7c7c2d2a231638 b94aa8c500bcda/dnnc.sb3 ) what changed?
